Requirements:
=============

All:
----
* install drivers that can be found in the mounted CDROM
* auto-login
* prebootstrap.py set to run on login
* numpy
* turn off auto-updates (you want your base image to be clean w/ no updates!)
* python lxml module
* any other python modules/dependencies that need to be compiled or
	installed via an installer

Windows:
--------

Make sure the following are installed:

* comtypes
* pip install requests
* Windbg
* potentially pre-generated fastoche comtypes python files
* python
* VCREDIST 2012 x86 AND x64 (for windbg msec.dll)
* msec.dll in the winext folder of both x86 and x64 windbgs
* psexec (all pstools?)

Be sure to do the following:

* turn off UAC

You must also configure WINRM by doing (in an Administrator cmd.exe):

	winrm quickconfig -q
	winrm set winrm/config/winrs @{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="512"}
	winrm set winrm/config @{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}
	winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}
	winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
	sc config WinRM start= auto

Also note that all created networks in the VM must be set the “Work”
network. This can be set to be the default action by going to:

	Open "gpedit.msc" -> Go to Computer Configration –> Windows Settings –> Security Settings –> Network list manager

It may also help to attempt to shrink the size of the VM using sdelete

	sdelete -z C:

Linux:
------

Make sure the following are installed:

* pip (apt-get install python-pip)
* python

Be sure to do the following:

* passwordless sudo

Prebootstrap.py
===============
You must put the prebootstrap.py file found here onto the VM and set it
to run on login. The prebootstrap.py script will wait for a file named
RUN_TALUS_RUN to appear in the system's temporary directory, at which
point it will import and run the bootstrap (and hence your jobs).
